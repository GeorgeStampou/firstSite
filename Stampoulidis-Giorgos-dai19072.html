                <h3>Name</h3>
                     <p>
                        The rules of association football were codified in England by FA in 1863 and the name association football was coined
                        to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. 
                        The word soccer (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.
                        Within the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called "football" in the United Kingdom and mainly
                        "soccer" in Canada and the United States. People in countries where other codes of football are prevalent 
                        (Australia, Ireland, Wales, South Africa and New Zealand) may use either term, although national associations in Australia 
                        and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.

                 <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. According to FIFA, the Chinese competitive 
                        game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball") is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence. Cuju players could 
                        use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably
                        similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred.
                        During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.
